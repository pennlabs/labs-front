              Penn Labs builds products that help students navigate life at
              Penn. All Penn students are eligible to apply for any position,
              regardless of major or year.
              <br />
              <br /> Some Penn Labs products that you may be familiar with
              include Penn Course Review, Penn Mobile, and Penn Course Alert.
              We’ve had more than 100,000 total users of our products. Through
              the Common Funding Application we build and maintain, we've helped
              processed over $930,000 in grants for student organizations.
              <br />
              <br /> Our mission is to build tech products to serve all Penn
              students, and we recognize that goal requires a decent amount of
              commitment and technical experience. We meet for 4 hours each week
              to work on projects, discuss future product roadmaps, and learn
              more about the technologies we use. Members are also expected to
              work outside of meetings to meet product goals. While technical
              ability varies when joining Penn Labs and our members are always
              learning, our commitment to building quality products means that
              we seek candidates with sufficient technical ability, which we
              evaluate through the technical challenge phase of the application
              process.
              <br />
              <br /> Come out to our info sessions <b>Tuesday 9/3</b> and{' '}
              <b>Thursday 9/5</b> from <b>6-7pm in JMHH 340</b> to learn more
              and meet our members! And feel free to reach out to
